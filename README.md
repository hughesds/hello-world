# hello-world
Just another repository
I was a programmer 20 years ago, and now I am a data architect. I don't write anything but SQL and usually, I just write the spec so someone else can write SQL.
The last actual program I wrote was in C. Not C#, C. I typed code into a text file and then compiled it with a DOS command-line linker/compiler.
